# GuiCryptoJournal

This is a GUI program for encrypting and writing a journal. 

It can also be used as a password manager.

This was written as a hobby project in a fairly short space of time.

See the section below for plans and notes regarding design and refactoring.

Usage
=
`python2 gui.py` 

Future
=
Migrate to `python` version 3.

Extract cryptographic functionality from `gui.py` and encapsulate in separate class.

Try to cut down the size of the main `SecureJournalGui` class.

Limit one class to one file.
