# JavaAdventure
Java based role playing game.

This project was my solution to an assignment for [SWEN20003](https://handbook.unimelb.edu.au/2021/subjects/swen20003).

Notes
=
The shell script will compile and run the game using the correct class and library paths.

Installation
=

The `./lib/native` folder contains the `lwjgl` binaries for Windows, Mac and Linux. 

There is a README in `./lib/native` with further details.

Usage
=
`./run.sh`
